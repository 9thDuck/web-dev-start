      Born on 10<sup>th</sup> July 1856, an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the
      Military
      Frontier, in the
      Austrian Empire(present day Croatia). Nikola Tesla was fourth of five children. His father, Milutin Tesla was an
      Eastern Orthodox priest. His mother Duka Mandic, was unschooled but highly intelligent. She had a talent for
      making home
      craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Tesla credited his eidetic
      memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence.</p>

  <section id="education">
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p> Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan. He studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, family move to
      the nearby Gospic, where his father worked as a parish priest. Nikola completed primary and middle school here.
      Then he moved to Karvolac to attend high school at Higher Real Gymnasium. Tesla later wrote that he became
      interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor, noting them as "mysterious phenomena" that
      "made him want to know more". He could perform intergral calculus in his head which prompted his teachers to
      believe he was cheating. He finished a four year term in three years, graduating in 1873. He returned to Smiljan
      after that in 1873, where he contracted cholera and was bedridden for 9 months. He was near to death multiple
      times. His father who initially wanted Nikola to enter priesthood, promised to send him to the best engineering
      school if he recovered from the illness.
      In 1874, Nikola evaded conscription into army in Smiljan, by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near
      Gračac. He explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb. He said that this contact with nature made him stronger,
      both physically and mentally. He read many while in Tomingaj, and later said that Mark Twain's works helped him
      miraculously recover from his earlier illness.</p><span class="dots">...</span>

    <span class="more">
      <p>In 1875, Nikola enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz on a Military Frontier scholarship. In
        first year, he never missed a lecture and earned highest grades, passed twice as many exams than it was
        required.
        He even received a letter of commendation from the dean to his father stating,"Your son is a star of first
        rank."
        Tesla was fascinated by lectures on electricity by Professor Jakob Pöschl.</p>

      <p>Tesla had reputation of being a hard worker. After his father passed away in 1879, Nikola found a package of
        letters from his professors to his father warning that unless he were removed from the school, Nikola would die
        through overwork. At Graz he first saw the Gramme dynamo, which operated as a generator and, when reversed,
        became
        an electric motor, and he conceived a way to use alternating current to advantage. At the end of his second
        year,
        Tesla became addicted to gambling. In his third year, he gambled
        away his allowance and his tuition money which he later gained back his initial losses and returning the balance
        to his family. When examinations neared, Nikola was unprepared and asked for extension to study, which was
        denied.
        He didn't receive any grades for third year, and he never graduated from college.</p>

      <p>In 1878, he left Graz and severed all relations with his family to hide the fact that he dropped out of
        college.

    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p>Later, at Budapest, he visualized the principle of the rotating magnetic field and developed plans for
      an
      induction motor that would become his first step toward the successful utilization of alternating current. In 1882
      Tesla went to work in Paris for the Continental Edison Company, and, while on assignment to Strassburg in 1883, he
      constructed, after work hours, his first induction motor. Tesla sailed for America in 1884, arriving in New York
      with four cents in his pocket, a few of his own poems, and calculations for a flying machine. He first found
      employment with Thomas Edison, but the two inventors were far apart in background and methods, and their
      separation was inevitable.</p> <span class="dots">...</span>

    <span class="more">
      <p>In May 1888 George Westinghouse, head of the Westinghouse Electric Company in Pittsburgh, bought the patent
        rights to Tesla’s polyphase system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors. The transaction
        precipitated a titanic power struggle between Edison’s direct-current systems and the Tesla-Westinghouse
        alternating-current approach, which eventually won out.</p>

      <p>Tesla soon established his own laboratory, where his inventive mind could be given free rein. He experimented
        with shadowgraphs similar to those that later were to be used by Wilhelm Röntgen when he discovered X-rays in
        1895. Tesla’s countless experiments included work on a carbon button lamp, on the power of electrical resonance,
        and on various types of lighting.</p>

      <p>In order to allay fears of alternating currents, Tesla gave exhibitions in his laboratory in which he lit lamps
        by allowing electricity to flow through his body. He was often invited to lecture at home and abroad. The Tesla
        coil, which he invented in 1891, is widely used today in radio and television sets and other electronic
        equipment.
        That year also marked the date of Tesla’s U.S. citizenship.</p>

      <p>Westinghouse used Tesla’s alternating current system to light the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago in
        1893. This success was a factor in their winning the contract to install the first power machinery at Niagara
        Falls, which bore Tesla’s name and patent numbers. The project carried power to Buffalo by 1896.</p>

      <p>In 1898 Tesla announced his invention of a teleautomatic boat guided by remote control. When skepticism was
        voiced, Tesla proved his claims for it before a crowd in Madison Square Garden.</p>

      <p>In Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he stayed from May 1899 until early 1900, Tesla made what he regarded as
        his
        most important discovery—terrestrial stationary waves. By this discovery he proved that Earth could be used as a
        conductor and made to resonate at a certain electrical frequency. He also lit 200 lamps without wires from a
        distance of 40 km (25 miles) and created man-made lightning, producing flashes measuring 41 metres (135 feet).
        At
        one time he was certain he had received signals from another planet in his Colorado laboratory, a claim that was
        met with derision in some scientific journals.</p>

      <p>Returning to New York in 1900, Tesla began construction on Long Island of a wireless world broadcasting tower,
        with $150,000 capital from the American financier J. Pierpont Morgan. Tesla claimed he secured the loan by
        assigning 51 percent of his patent rights of telephony and telegraphy to Morgan. He expected to provide
        worldwide
        communication and to furnish facilities for sending pictures, messages, weather warnings, and stock reports. The
        project was abandoned because of a financial panic, labour troubles, and Morgan’s withdrawal of support. It was
        Tesla’s greatest defeat.</p>

      <p>Tesla’s work then shifted to turbines and other projects. Because of a lack of funds, his ideas remained in his
        notebooks, which are still examined by enthusiasts for unexploited clues. In 1915 he was severely disappointed
        when a report that he and Edison were to share the Nobel Prize proved erroneous. Tesla was the recipient of the
        Edison Medal in 1917, the highest honour that the American Institute of Electrical Engineers could bestow.</p>

    <h3>Later Years</h3>
    <p>Tesla lived at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City from 1900 and ran up a large bill. He moved to the St. Regis
      Hotel in 1922 and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a different hotel every few years and leaving
      unpaid bills behind. Tesla walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons. He began feeding them at the window
      of his hotel room and nursed injured birds back to health. He said that he had been visited by a certain injured
      white pigeon daily. He spent over $2,000 to care for the bird, including a device he built to support her
      comfortably while her broken wing and leg healed.Tesla's unpaid bills, as well as complaints about the mess made
      by pigeons, led to his eviction from St. Regis in 1923. He was also forced to leave the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930
      and the Hotel Governor Clinton in 1934. At one point he also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.</p><span
      id="dots">...</span>

    <span class="more">
      <p>Tesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker in 1934. At this time Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company began
        paying him $125 per month in addition to paying his rent. Accounts of how this came about vary. Several sources
        claim that Westinghouse was concerned, or possibly warned, about potential bad publicity arising from the
        impoverished conditions in which their former star inventor was living. The payment has been described as being
        couched as a "consulting fee" to get around Tesla's aversion to accepting charity. Tesla biographer Marc Seifer
        described the Westinghouse payments as a type of "unspecified settlement". In any case, Westinghouse provided
        the
        funds for Tesla for the rest of his life.</p>

  <section id="death">
    <h3>Death</h3>
    <p>In the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his
      regular commute to the cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from
      the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched
      and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries was never known; Tesla refused
      to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.</p><span class="dots">...</span>

    <span class="more">
      <p>On 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was later
        found by maid Alice Monaghan after she had entered Tesla's room, ignoring the "do not disturb" sign that Tesla
        had
        placed on his door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body and ruled that
        the
        cause of death had been coronary thrombosis.</p>

      <p>After Tesla’s death the custodian of alien property impounded his trunks, which held his papers, his diplomas
        and
        other honours, his letters, and his laboratory notes. These were eventually inherited by Tesla’s nephew, Sava
        Kosanovich, and later housed in the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. Hundreds filed into New York City’s
        Cathedral
        of St. John the Divine for his funeral services, and a flood of messages acknowledged the loss of a great
        genius.
        Three Nobel Prize recipients addressed their tribute to “one of the outstanding intellects of the world who
        paved
        the way for many of the technological developments of modern times.</p>
